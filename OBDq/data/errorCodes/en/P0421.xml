        <meaning rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">Basically this means that the oxygen sensor downstream of the catalytic converter on bank 1 is detecting that the converter is not working as efficiently as it should be (according to specs). It is part of the vehicle emissions system.</meaning>

    <solutions>
        <solution rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">Measure the voltage at the oxygen sensor on Bank 1 (the rear sensor, or the sensor after the converter). In fact, it would be a good idea to test each oxygen O2 sensor while you're at it.One thing to note is that many vehicle manufacturers offer a longer warranty on emissionsrelated parts. So if you have a newer car but it's out of it's bumpertobumper warranty, there still may be warranty on this type of problem. Many manufacturers give a five year, unlimited mileage warranty on these items. It's worth checking into.</solution>

        <symptom rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">You will likely not notice any drivability problems, although there may be symptoms. The code may be more likely to occur after the engine has had numerous cold starts in the past 12 days.</symptom>
