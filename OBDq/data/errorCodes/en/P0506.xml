    <meanings>
        <meaning rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">This P0506 code is one that's sometimes triggered on vehicles that have electronic throttle control. That is, they don't have a regular throttle cable from the accelerator pedal to the engine. They rely on sensors and electronics to control the throttle. In this case, the P0506 DTC (diagnostic trouble code) is triggered when the PCM (powertrain control module) detects an engine idle speed that is lower than the desired (preprogrammed) RPM.</meaning>

    <solutions>
        <solution rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">This DTC is more of an informational code, so if there are any other codes set, diagnose them first. If there are no other codes, inspect for vacuum leaks, restrictions, and damage. If there are no symptoms other than the DTC itself, just clear the code and see whether it returns.Other related DTCs: P0507</solution>

    <symptoms>
        <symptom rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">Most likely the only thing you'll notice is the idle speed is lower than normal so it will likely be rougher. There are potentially other symptoms as well. Of course, when trouble codes are set, the MIL (malfunction indicator lamp, a.k.a. the check engine light) illuminates.</symptom>
