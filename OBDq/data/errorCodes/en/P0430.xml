        <meaning rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">Basically this means that the oxygen sensor downstream of the catalytic converter on bank 2 is detecting that the converter is not working as efficiently as it should be (according to specs). It is part of the vehicle emissions system.</meaning>

        <cause rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">An oxygen sensor is not reading (functioning) properly</cause>

    <solutions>
        <solution rtPlus="0" rtNeutral="0" rtMinus="0">First, inspect for exhaust leaks.Next step is to measure the voltage at the oxygen sensor on Bank 2. In fact, it would be a good idea to test each oxygen O2 sensor while you're at it.One thing to note is that many vehicle manufacturers offer a longer warranty on emissionsrelated parts. So if you have a newer car but it's out of it's bumpertobumper warranty, there still may be warranty on this type of problem. Many manufacturers give a five year, unlimited mileage warranty on these items. It's worth checking into.</solution>
